        <p class="lead">2018 was the year that RITMO went from idea to reality. Even though many things have changed since we first started planning RITMO in 2012, the core people, the main ideas, and the excitement of being part of something quite unique, is still there!</p>
        <p>One of the things we are most proud of, is the truly interdisciplinary nature of RITMO. Everyone is talking about the need to work across disciplines, but not so many really try to do this in practice. As Centre Directors we spent a lot of time in 2018 on building a solid administrative and organizational platform for a centre that spans three departments in three faculties. We are grateful for the support we have received from the University of Oslo throughout this process, and we believe that the establishment of RITMO has helped pave the way for future interdisciplinary initiatives.</p>
        <p>The most important part of RITMO is the people working here. Many people moved from their host departments to RITMO in August 2018, and soon after we welcomed the first group of new recruits as they arrived in September. It was fantastic to see our premises change from a construction site into a buzzing working environment in just a few months.</p>
        <p>2018 was the year of change, the year that RITMO came into being. Here we present some highlights from the year, in time, rhythm, and motion.</p>

      <h2 class="section-heading">RITMO at a Glance</h2>
      <p>Rhythm is omnipresent in human life, as we walk, talk, dance and play; as we tell stories about our past; and as we predict the future. Rhythm is also central to human biology, from the oscillations of our nervous system to our heartbeats, breathing patterns and longer chronobiological cycles. As such, it is a key aspect of human action and perception that is in complex interplay with the various cultural, biological and mechanical rhythms of the world.</p>
      <p>RITMO undertakes research on rhythm in human action and perception, using music, motion and audio-visual media as empirical points of departure. Our core idea is that the human ability to experience the world and our actions as rhythmic, points to basic perceptual and cognitive mechanisms that are in themselves rhythmic in nature. <strong>The vision of RITMO</strong> is to understand more about these mechanisms, and through this generate new knowledge about the ways in which humans structure and understand the temporal dimensions of their life.</p>
      <p>The centre is interdisciplinary and combines perspectives and methods from music and media studies, philosophy and aesthetics, cognitive neuroscience, and informatics, using state-of-the-art technologies for motion capture, neuroimaging, pupillometry and robotics.</p>

      <p>The solution was to engage in a creative process with the design company Anagram and the composer Jon Balke. The end result is a sonic-visual profile that captures some of the creative spirit of RITMO, and that can be reconfigured endlessly.</p>

            'The TIME research cluster addresses the ways in which rhythm impacts the structuring of temporal events beyond the ‚Äònow‚Äô, that is, the extent to which rhythm plays a role in remembering and structuring longer time spans. We will also investigate the relationship between rhythm and the experience of fragmented time.',
            'A second priority is to investigate the temporality of experiences of pleasure and absorption, the fact that rhythm facilitates entrainment and synchronization, and the social dimensions of this aspect of rhythm. A related question is how philosophical, psychological, and historical explorations of time can be revisited through new interdisciplinary perspectives on the experience of rhythm.',
            'Our aim is to understand how rhythm underpins our ability to structure and remember large-scale formations of time, and to understand the related processes of pleasure and engagement.'

            'The MOTION research cluster focuses on the analysis of human body rhythm and the synthesis of rhythms with machines. The aim is to understand more about the human body\'s internal and external rhythms and how rhythms can be used in interaction. It is also relevant to understand how music influences people\'s body motion, such as in dancing, but also when trying to stand still. Knowledge about the motion-inducing effects of music can then be used in the creation of interactive systems in which the music is controlled through the human body.',
            'The empirical work is done using various types of motion capture systems and physiological measurements. The analysis and synthesis parts also greatly involve computer-based analysis methods, and in particular different types of machine learning systems. The synthesis part includes both the creation of visual displays of motion (animations) and the creation and use of robots to create physical motion.',
            'The aim is to create basic knowledge that can be used in the development of advanced rhythmic human-robot interaction, such as in dancing.'
